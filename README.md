# WeatherProject
Get weather forecast for any city using weather API.

Packages used:
1. express
2. https
3. bodyParser

NOTE: As this project uses the above node packages, we need to install node modules before actually start using the project. (node_modules folder not pushed to repo)

How to install the required node packages and start using the app?
1. Clone the project to local
2. Navigate to the project directory in terminal (WeatherProject)
3. Install the required packages:
a. express => npm i express
b. https => npm i https
c. bodyParser => npm i body-parser
4. Run nodemon app.js in terminal
5. Now the application will be accessable in "http://localhost:3000/"
